## 🛠 Features

### 1. **Adjustments (⚙)**
- **Brightness ☀:** Increase or decrease the brightness of the image.  
- **Contrast 🎚:** Adjust the contrast to enhance or soften the differences in light and dark areas.  
- **Sharpness 🔪:** Make details sharper or softer.  

### 2. **Filters & Effects (🎨)**
- **Grayscale:** Convert image to black & white while preserving intensity.  
- **Sepia:** Apply a warm brown tone for a vintage look.  
- **Blur:** Smooth the image using Gaussian blur; intensity adjustable.  
- **Cartoon / Cartoon Colorful:** Transform images into cartoon-style or colorful cartoon with edge enhancement.  
- **HDR Enhanced:** Enhance local contrast using CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization).  

### 3. **Editing Tools (🛠)**
- **Denoise 🧹:** Reduce noise in the image using non-local means denoising.  
- **Rotate 90° 🔄:** Rotate image 90 degrees clockwise.  
- **Crop ✂:** Select a region to crop interactively using drag box.  
- **Add Text 📝:** Add custom text anywhere on the image with adjustable font size and color.  

### 4. **Interactive Notebook (Jupyter)**
The notebook `editing.ipynb` includes step-by-step image editing:
- **Adjust Hue & Saturation:** Modify color tones for artistic effects.  
- **CLAHE Color:** Improve local contrast while preserving color.  
- **Brightness & Contrast:** Enhance image lighting.  
- **Denoise:** Remove noise for cleaner images.  
- **Resize:** Change image size while maintaining aspect ratio.  
- **Filters:** Apply different filters by selecting filter numbers.  
- **Rotate, Flip, Crop:** Interactive control over rotation angles, flipping directions (vertical/horizontal), and cropping region.  
- **Gamma Correction:** Adjust luminance of the image for tonal correction.  
- **Oil Painting Effect, Watercolor, Vintage Effect:** Artistic stylizations.  
- **Face Beautification:** Smooth skin tones and enhance facial features.  
- **Object Removal:** Erase objects interactively using freehand mask.  

### 5. **Undo & Download**
- **Undo ↩:** Step back to previous editing stage.  
- **Download 💾:** Save the final edited image as PNG.
